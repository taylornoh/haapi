### Haapi is a cross-platform mobile application developed in React Native to help support small AAPI owned businesses. Using the TomTom Search API, we are able to let customers know of Asian businesses near them. We also store business data using CockroachDB. 

Users that identify as customers are given a feed of nearby Asian businesses in their area with information such as the business address, website, and phone number.

Users that identify as businesses are can register their shop and post pictures about events and deals they have to the "News" page, which can be seen by customers.
